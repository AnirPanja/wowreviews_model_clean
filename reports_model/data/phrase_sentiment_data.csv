The waiter ( name I cannot recall) was really good as he went out of his way to serve and answer questions my wife was asking him regarding the menu.

Next day we had an early morning flight to catch, after checking out we faced difficulties with the arranged taxi, your reception staff (Mr Himanshu, Mr Vinod and Mr Mayur) were very helpful in assisting us with our transport and calming us with refreshment while we waited. Before booking the reservations at your hotel we had already made provisional booking for a hotel at AeroCity, (that being closer to the airport) After staying at Four Points Sheraton, we WILL be highly recommending all our friends and family to stay here as your staff are your BEST asset.
